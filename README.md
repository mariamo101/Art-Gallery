## Overview
  I'm trying to build this site by figma com. In the process of working I had challenges that I overcame and learned something new.
### The challenge
 The challenge was to make the letters have two colors at the same time.

  The actual problem remains to perfectly adapt this site to different devices

## My process
 My process is going slowly but fruitfully. I gain new experience in the process of solving problems.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

  I learned how to use background: linear-gradient.

  I learned how to link one page to another and be able to click from one to the other.

```css
.css {
     background: linear-gradient(to right, rgb(255 255 255) 0%, #ffffff 55%, rgba(0 0 0)5%);
}
```
